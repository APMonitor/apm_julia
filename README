APMonitor Optimization Suite

The APMonitor Modeling Language is optimization software for mixed-integer and differential
algebraic equations. It is coupled with large-scale solvers for linear, quadratic, nonlinear,
and mixed integer programming (LP, QP, NLP, MILP, MINLP). Modes of operation include data
reconciliation, real-time optimization, dynamic simulation, and nonlinear predictive control.
It is freely available through MATLAB, Python, Julia, or from a web browser interface.

This version is compatible with Julia 0.4.0.
