  Variables
    x[1] = 2
    x[2] = sqrt(2)
    x[3] = -1
    x[4] = 2-sqrt(2)
    x[5] = 1/2
  End Variables

  Equations
    x[1] + x[2]^2 + x[3]^3 = 3
    x[2] - x[3]^2 + x[4] = 1
    x[1]*x[5] = 1

    ! best known objective = 0
    minimize (x[1]-x[2])^2 + (x[2]-x[3])^3 + (x[3]-x[4])^4 + (x[4]-x[5])^4
  End Equations
End Model
