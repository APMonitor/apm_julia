Model hs12
  Variables
    x[1] = 0
    x[2] = 0
  End Variables

  Equations
    4*x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 <= 25

    ! best known objective = -30
    ! best known solution
    ! x[1] = 2
    ! x[1] = 3
    ! note: solver may find local minimum at x[1]=0,x[2]=0
    minimize (x[1]^2)/2 + x[2]^2 - x[1]*x[2] - 7*x[1] - 7*x[2]
  End Equations
End Model
