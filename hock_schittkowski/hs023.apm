  Variables
    x[1] = 3, <=50, >=-50
    x[2] = 1, <=50, >=-50
  End Variables

  Equations
    x[1] + x[2] >= 1
    x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 >= 1
    9*x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 >= 9
    x[1]^2 - x[2] >= 0
    x[2]^2 - x[1] >= 0    

    ! best known objective = 2
    minimize x[1]^2 + x[2]^2
  End Equations
End Model
