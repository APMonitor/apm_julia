  Variables
    x[1] = 0, >=0
    x[2] = 0, >=0
    x[3] = 3, >=0
  End Variables

  Equations
    x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 <= x[3]^2
    x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2 >= 4
    x[3] <= 5                   

    ! best known objective = sqrt(2) - 6
    minimize (x[1] - 1)*(x[1] - 2)*(x[1] - 3) + x[3]
  End Equations
End Model
